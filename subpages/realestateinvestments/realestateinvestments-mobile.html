      <h1> Farmington, Maine </h1>
      <p class = "example">
        In 2015, after extensive research on wealth building, financial independence, and real estate investing, my wife and I decided we were ready to purchase our first home. Armed with that knowledge, we went a slightly unconventional route by purchasing a duplex in Farmington, Maine, the town where we were living. We did extensive updates to it while living there and even added an additional unit converting it to a triplex. We still own it today and we hold true to our original mission: to create quality living spaces and to provide professional management.

      <h1> Waterville, Maine </h1>
      <div >
        <p>
          Our next adventure in real estate investing brought us to the city of Waterville. We identified a run-down property in a great location with close proximity to the downtown area. We knew that the city - with the help of Colby College - had been investing heavily into the revitalization of their downtown. So, we entered into a rent-to-own agreement with its owner and started the renovations. Then life hit us with a job relocation for my wife, and later, a beautiful baby boy. Suddenly, our project timeline got really stretched. After just over two years we finally wrapped it up and our foresight, risk tolerance, and hard work paid off when we sold it for full asking price after just one week on the market.
