      <br/>
      <p class = "example">
        My first job after relocating to the MidCoast area was the Jacobs’ project. This was a beautiful and unique home located on Westport Island. The home had a very elegant half moon shape to it that rises to greet the Sheepscot River. Our task was to take the 1,500 square foot, daylight basement space and convert it into living space. We added a study, an office, a full bathroom, kitchenette, and wine closet.  Some of my favorite highlights of this project was the curved enclosure on the ceiling - created to hide the radiant heat pipes and matching the same curved profile as the foundation - and the removable curved panels made to hide the mechanicals. With the addition of the solid cherry doors and window trim the ground floor project was now tied seamlessly to the rest of the modern house.<br/><br/>

      <h2>The Haunt</h2>
        <p class = "example">
          The Haunt was a really fun and challenging project. The building, located in Phippsburg, Maine, is used as a summer rental. Originally built in the 1800’s as a rooming house for fishermen this place has ample history and charm. However, the summer heat and lack of insulation and venting made it less then ideal for visitors during the hot summer months. We came in and added additional rafters for support and knee walls to separate the attic storage from the main living space, and then installed venting, insulation and vapor barrier. After everything was sealed up tight we installed custom white wash tongue & groove pine, recessed lighting, and a large ceiling fan. We achieved an updated look while preserving the building’s charm.

      <h2>Perkins</h2>
      <p class = "example" style = "grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 2;">
        The Perkins’ deck project was all about that view! After removing the old deck, we constructed a new one with more space for enjoying that amazing seascape. After many years of scraping and painting the old deck, the Perkins were looking for something with much less maintenance. We used composite decking and white vinyl rail systems to eliminate the need for yearly maintenance. A fun added design feature was the extended corner posts that we strung a cable across to hang bird feeders and plants.

      <h2>Millwork</h2>
        <p class = "example">
          In addition to building and renovating, we also offer custom millwork products. Using only “blow downs” or other compromised trees we make an effort to help the forest while creating some unique products. White pine slabs, wide pine boards, and cedar beams are just a few examples. The pine slabs look great as countertops, tabletops, or open shelving and the beams can be great accent pieces.
